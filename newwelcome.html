      <h1>Welcome to iUtilities</h1>
      <h2 class="sub">Welcome</h2>
      <p>Hey! Looks like this is the first time you run AirForce! First of all, welcome and thanks for downloading!</p>
      <p>AirForce is the ultimate flying tool, that gives you real-time and detailed informations about flights and airports.<br>Using different sources, AirForce gives you complete and well-looking results in a spark.</p>

<h2>Dependencies</h2>
<p>AirForce doesn't need any third party apps to work, you just need an internet connection. <br>And about the updater, AirForce supports Swing Updater ðŸ„´, so you don't need to download any other shortcut.</p> <p>You'll be asked to allow AirForce to access some websites. These sites are AirForce's sources and the shortcut will only get data from them. Please allow these. <p>

<h2>Enjoy AirForce!</h2>
<p>When you are ready, tap <b>Done</b> and start with a quick setup before enjoying AirForce.</p>
<p>Please take note that this is a beta release, so there may be bugs or issues.<br>I ask you all to report me all problems you find, but I'm also open to suggestions and requests.</I></p>
